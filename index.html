    <h1>The Indian Constituition</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        The Indian Constitution is the supreme law of India, which lays down the framework for the countryâ€™s political system, government, and fundamental rights of citizens. It was adopted on 26th November 1949 and came into effect on 26th January 1950, which is celebrated as Republic Day.
        
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
        It is the longest written constitution in the world, containing 448 articles divided into 25 parts and 12 schedules. It establishes India as a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic while ensuring justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity for all citizens.
        
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
        The Constitution provides a parliamentary system of government, where the President is the head of state, and the Prime Minister is the head of government. It also defines the structure of the legislature, executive, and judiciary and distributes powers between the central and state governments through federal principles.
        
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
        One of its most important features is the Fundamental Rights (Part III), which guarantees essential freedoms to citizens. It also includes Directive Principles of State Policy (Part IV), guiding the government in making policies for social and economic welfare. The Fundamental Duties (added by the 42nd Amendment in 1976) remind citizens of their responsibilities toward the nation.
        
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
        The Indian Constitution is a living document, meaning it can be amended when necessary. Since 1950, it has been amended several times to adapt to changing needs, with the First Amendment (1951) and the 73rd and 74th Amendments (1992) being some of the most significant changes.
        
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
        Drafted under the leadership of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the Constitution is a symbol of Indiaâ€™s unity, diversity, and commitment to democracy. It ensures that the country functions smoothly while protecting the rights and freedoms of its people.
        
    </p>

    <div id="Rights" class="container mt-5 text-white">
        <h2 class="text-center">Fundamental Rights</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            The Indian Constitution provides every citizen with certain essential rights to ensure freedom, equality, and justice. These are known as Fundamental Rights and protect individuals from unfair treatment by the government or society.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            <b>The Right to Equality</b> ensures that all citizens are treated equally before the law...
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            <b>The Right to Freedom</b> allows individuals to express their opinions freely, move and live anywhere in India, and choose their profession. People have the right to form groups or associations and peacefully protest. It also protects citizens from unfair punishments and arrests. Additionally, children between the ages of 6 and 14 have the right to free and compulsory education.
            
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            <b>The Right Against Exploitation</b> protects individuals from forced labor and human trafficking. No one can be forced to work against their will, and children under 14 cannot be employed in hazardous jobs such as factories or mines. This right ensures that every person is treated with dignity and fairness.
            
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            <b>The Right to Freedom of Religion</b> allows every citizen to follow, practice, and spread their religion freely. Religious places and organizations have the right to manage their own affairs without government interference. No person can be forced to pay taxes for religious activities, and government-run schools cannot impose religious teachings on students.
            
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            <b>The Cultural and Educational Rights</b> protect the identity and heritage of different communities in India. Every group has the right to preserve its language, culture, and traditions. Minority communities can establish and run their own educational institutions to promote their culture and values.
            
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            <b>The Right to Constitutional Remedies</b> is considered the most important right, as it allows individuals to approach the Supreme Court or High Courts if any of their fundamental rights are violated. The courts have the power to issue special orders, known as writs, to protect these rights and ensure justice is served.
            
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            These fundamental rights are essential for maintaining democracy and ensuring that every citizen enjoys freedom, dignity, and equality in society.
